# Try Node.js

My first node.js practice. :)
This project include mocha and zombie to test node.js server,
and also using blanket to report the coverage.

## Usage Node.js Server

Simply use make.
For more detail to see the [Makefile](https://github.com/RickyChien/try-nodejs/blob/master/Makefile).

1. Install [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org)

2. To fetch dependent packages, enter the try-nodejs folder and run

        $ make install

3. To start the server, assume you are in the try-nodejs folder and run

        $ make run-server

  Now you can open browser to see the web page at [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

## Unit Tests

Run unit test by mocha.
For more detail to see the [Makefile](https://github.com/RickyChien/try-nodejs/blob/master/Makefile).

In the try-nodejs folder run

        $ make test

## Test Coverage

Watch test coverage report generated by blanket.
For more detail to see the [Makefile](https://github.com/RickyChien/try-nodejs/blob/master/Makefile).

In the try-nodejs folder run

        $ make test-coverage

## Clean 

Clean up your working directory.
In the try-nodejs folder run
    
        $ make clean
